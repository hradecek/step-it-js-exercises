# Practice 1

To request data from the user, you must use [`prompt()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt) and print
the result using [`alert()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert).

1. Ask the user for a number, raise this number to a power of 2
and display.

2. Ask the user for 2 numbers and output the arithmetic mean of
these numbers.

3. Ask the user for length of the square side and output the area
of that square.

4. Implement a converter from kilometers to miles (the user enters
kilometers, and the program displays miles). 1km = 0.621371miles.
Specify this value in the code as a constant.

5. Implement a calculator. The user enters two numbers, and the
program displays the results of + - * / between these numbers.

6. The user enters values of a and b for the formula a * x + b = 0,
and the program calculates and displays the value of x.

7. Ask the user for current time (hours and minutes) and display
how many hours and minutes remain until the next day.

8. Ask the user for a three-digit number and print the second
digit of that number. To solve the problem, use the % operator
(remainder of division).

9. Ask the user for a five-digit number and move the last digit
to the beginning (you should get the number 51234 from the
number 12345).

10. Employeeâ€™s salary is $250 + 10% of sales. Ask for the total amount
of sales for a month and calculate the salary.

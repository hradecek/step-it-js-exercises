## Task 1
Create an array of 10 random numbers and write several functions
to work with it.

1. The function takes an array and displays it on the screen.

2. The function takes an array and outputs only even elements.

3. The function takes an array and returns the sum of all elements
of the array.

4. The function takes an array and returns its maximum element.

5. The function of adding a new element to the array by the specified

6. The function of removing an element from an array by the

## Task 2
Create another array of 5 random numbers and write the following
functions.

1. The function takes 2 arrays and returns a new array, in which
all the elements of two arrays are collected without repetitions.

2. The function takes 2 arrays and returns a new array in which
common elements are collected (that is, elements that occur in
both the first and second arrays) without repetition.

3. The function takes 2 arrays and returns a new array, in which
all the elements from the first array are collected which are not
in the second array.

## Task 3
Create an array of fruits and sort it alphabetically. Write the
following functions.

1. Displaying with document.write() as a list (using the ul and

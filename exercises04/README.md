# Practice 4

1. Write a function that takes 2 numbers and returns the smaller
of them.

2. Write a function that raises the transmitted number to the
specified power.

3. Write a function that takes 2 numbers and a sign (+ - * /),
calculates it, and returns the result.

4. Write a function that checks whether the number passed to it
is prime.

5. Write a function that takes a number and displays a multiplication
table for this number. Call the function for all numbers from
2 to 9.

6. Write a function that implements the operation of the % operator.
The function takes 2 parameters and returns the remainder from
dividing the first parameter by the second. In the function, use
only + - * /, the % operator should not be used.

7. Write a function that takes numbers from 1 to 5 and returns
their sum.

8. Write a function that takes numbers from 1 to 5 and returns
the larger of them.

9. Write a function that outputs all even or odd numbers in a range
specified by the user. Numbers to be output are determined by
the third parameter of the bool type (true – even, false – odd).

10. Write a function that takes a date (day, month, year) and returns
the date of the next day as a string "dd.mm.yyyy". It is desirable
to write check for a leap year as a separate function.

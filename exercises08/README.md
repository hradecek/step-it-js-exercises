# Practice 8

1. Write a function that takes 2 strings and compares their length.
The function returns 1 if the first line contains more characters
than the second, -1 if the second contains more characters than
the first, or 0 if the strings are of the same length.

2. Write a function that converts the first character of a passed
string to uppercase.

3. Write a function that counts vowels in a passed string.

4. Write a function to check spam in a passed string. The function
returns true if the string contains spam. The following words
are to be considered as spam: 100% free, sales increase,
only today, do not delete, xxx. The function must be case
insensitive.

5. Write a truncate function. The function takes a string and
its maximum length. If the string length is greater than the
maximum, then extra characters are discarded, and multiple
periods are added instead of them.
For example: truncate("Hello, world!", 8) should return
"Hello...". 

6. Write a function that checks whether the passed string is a
palindrome.

7. Write a function that counts words in a sentence.

8. Write a function that returns the longest word in a sentence.

9. Write a function that considers the average word length in a
sentence.

10. Write a function that takes a string and a character and outputs
index of the character position in the string. Also, output how
many times this character occurs in a string.

To output the data, use [`alert()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert).
To enter data, use [`prompt()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt) and [`confirm()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/confirm).

## Tasks in which you want to use `while`
1. Output `#` as many times as the user specified.

2. The user entered a number, and all numbers from the entered
one to 0 must be displayed.

3. Ask for a number and a power. Raise the number to the specified
power and output the result.

4. Ask for 2 numbers and find all common divisors.

5. Calculate factorial of the number entered by the user.

## Tasks in which you want to use `do-while`
1. Ask the user to solve this "2 + 2 * 2" until they calculate it correctly.

2. Divide 1000 by 2 until you get a number that is less than 50.
Output this number and the amount of divisions.

## Tasks in which you want to use `for`
1. Display all numbers from 1 to 100, which are multiples of the
number specified by the user.

2. Output each 4th element from the user-specified range. The user
specifies the minimum and maximum range values.

3. Request a number and check whether it is prime. A prime
number is divided only by itself and by one without a remainder

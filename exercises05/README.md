# Practice 5

## Use recursion in all tasks.
1. Write a function that calculates factorial of a given number.

2. Write a function that outputs all the numbers from the range
defined by the user in the direct order. And one more function
to output them in reverse order.

3. Write a function that prints the number passed to it backwards.
For example: print out the number 1234 as 4321.

4. Write a function that calculates the sum of digits of a number.
For example: the number is 1357, the sum is 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16.

5. Write a function that takes a number and displays the
corresponding number of nested pairs of parentheses.
For example: the number is 4 â€“ (((()))).
